- ⚡ Fun fact: The first website ever created is still live and can be visited today. It was built by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, and went live on August 6, 1991.
   The website served as an introduction to the World Wide Web project and provided information on how to create web pages and set up web servers.
   You can still access this historic website at its original URL: http://info.cern.ch.
